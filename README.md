# scenetrackerWIP

not working at the moment ;) Work in Progress

i'm working on my own scentracker, which i've developed a long time ago ;) So it needs some updates and because of that I'm working on it to make it usable as a plugin :)

planned features: add a date for every scene add members of scene add a history in profil (always display if scene is read - furthermore you can chose if you want to make a difference between ingame and old scenes)

if the member want to: all scenes on index: choose: alway, if you have to post, if a certain user have posted

Notification (admin can choose if my alert or orivate message) member can choose: always, new answer, none

remind a user to post if he let others wait for more than X days
